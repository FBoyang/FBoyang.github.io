I am a third year Ph.D. student in Computer Science Department at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu/), advised by Prof. [Sriram Sankararaman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/). I acquired my Bachelor Degree in BS (Summa Cum Laude) from [Rutgers University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University) with a completion of Computer Science (Highest Honor) and Mathematics majors. I graduated from [Tianjin Yaohua High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaohua_High_School) in June, 2014. From September 2014, I started attending [Huahzong University of Science of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology) and majoring in bioinformatics (National Science Talent Training Base). In January 2016, I transferred to Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey. I completed my senior independent study under the supervising of Prof. [Desheng Zhang](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/) and Dr. [Zhihan Fang](http://zhihanfang.com/). Previously, I finished my internship via [Bruins-In-Genomics Summer Undergraduate Research Program](https://qcb.ucla.edu/big-summer/big2018/) in summer 2018 at UCLA. I was supervised by Prof. [Kevin Chen](https://genfaculty.rutgers.edu/kcchen/home) from May 2017 to December 2017. My main field of interests involves machine learning, data mining, computational genetics. Please feel free to reach out if you want to know more details. 


### Field of interests:

* Computational genetics  ｜  * Model interpretability
* Large-scale machine learning  ｜  * Causal inference

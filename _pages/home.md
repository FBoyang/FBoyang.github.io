I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/), Department of Biomedical Informatics, advised by Prof. [Marinka Zitnik](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu/), where I was advised by Prof. [Sriram Sankararaman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/). I earned my Bachelor's Degree (Summa Cum Laude) from [Rutgers University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University) with majors in Computer Science (Highest Honor) and Mathematics. Prior to that, from September 2014, I attended [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology) and majored in bioinformatics (National Science Talent Training Base). In January 2016, I transferred to Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey. I completed my senior independent study under the supervision of Prof. [Desheng Zhang](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/) and Dr. [Zhihan Fang](http://zhihanfang.com/). Previously, I finished my internship via [Bruins-In-Genomics Summer Undergraduate Research Program](https://qcb.ucla.edu/big-summer/big2018/) in summer 2018 at UCLA. I was supervised by Prof. [Kevin Chen](https://genfaculty.rutgers.edu/kcchen/home) from May 2017 to December 2017.

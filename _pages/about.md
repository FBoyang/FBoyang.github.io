I summarized some of the frequently asking questions from my friends who are not familiar with our field:

### Q&A 

1. Q: Am I a biologist or a computer scientist?
   
   A: <em> I consider myself a computer scientist. We write code, process data, apply ML algorithms, design pipelines, run large-scale jobs like other people in the CS area do. Not like biologists, I do not touch pipette or western blot or study live creatures! However, we do need to have a decent knowledge of populational genetics, molecular biology, etc. <em>

2. Q: As a computer science major, why do you study biology?

  A: <em> Many computer science researchers develop methods for specific applications. Just like researchers who focus their attention on computer vision, NLP, and cyber-physical systems, we focus our attention on answering biological questions <em>

3. Q: Why choose computational biology as my research field?

  A: <em> I found this is one of the most charming areas. The genetic signal we discovered can help better understand human beings and bring new opportunities for clinical care. <em>

4.Q: What methods do I use to solve the questions 

  A: <em> Genetic datasets are usually high dimensional with a limited sample size. Handling this kind of data requires more careful assumptions about the model and solid domain knowledge. Therefore, statistics, linear algebra, and data mining skills are essential for solving the problem. <em>

5. Q: Do I use deep learning:

  A: <em> Yes, but in a prudent manner. The straightforward implementation of deep learning algorithms usually doesnâ€™t work well in genetic datasets. Performance aspect, this could be due to the unique structure of the genetic dataset, the limited amount of training dataset, Computation aspect, this could be due to infeasibility to apply to the extremely high dimensional dataset. Finally, current deep learning models are generally hard to interpret, where interpretability is perhaps the most crucial factor in genetics. <em>

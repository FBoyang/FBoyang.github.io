I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu/), advised by Prof. [Sriram Sankararaman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/). I acquired my Bachelor Degree in BS from [Rutgers University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University) with a completion of Computer Science (Honor) and Mathematics majors. I graduated from [Tianjin Yaohua High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaohua_High_School) in June, 2014. From September 2014, I started attending [Huahzong University of Science of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology) and majoring in bioinformatics (base class). In January 2016, I transferred to Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey and changed my major to Computer Science & Mathematics. I am currently doing my independent study under the supervising of Prof. [Desheng Zhang](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/) and Dr. [Zhihan Fang](http://zhihanfang.com/). Previously, I finished my internship via [Bruins-In-Genomics Summer Undergraduate Research Program](https://qcb.ucla.edu/big-summer/big2018/) in summer 2018 at UCLA. I was supervised by Prof. [Kevin Chen](https://genfaculty.rutgers.edu/kcchen/home) from May 2017 to December 2017. My main field of interests involves machine learning, data mining, bioinformatics as well as cyber-physical system. Please feel free to reach out if you want to know more details.

EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm is one of the most popular approaches for parameter estimation under the presence of hidden variable; In this blog, I will help the audience have a better appreciation of the power of the EM-algorithm when applying it to ancestry inference, one of the popular studying areas in genomics. Specifically, I will offer a concrete example of using EM algorithm to reformulate the PCA algorithm. After reading this blog, I expect the audience to have a in depth understanding of the EM algorithm, how does it apply to the area of genetics, and how can it help the classical dimensinal reduction problems.
